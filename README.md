Arkanoid-like game with map generator.

Creating the map is pretty straightforward, on RMB is the menu
with keyboard shortcuts.

Ctrl + P runs the game on current map.

You control the platform with arrow keys and release the ball with space.

I haven't written the winning/loosing conditions yet so you can bounce the ball
indefinitly and if the ball falls off nothing happens.


//Game deffinitly runs on Chrome and Firefox, I'm not sure about other browsers since I havent tested on them.
//I haven't put much thought into making everything look good on any resolution so it might not be perfectly centered.
