Arkanoid-like game with map generator.

Creating the map is pretty straightforward, on RMB is the menu
with keyboard shortcuts.

Ctrl + P runs the game on current map.

You control the platform with arrow keys and release the ball with space.

I haven't written the winning/loosing conditions yet so you can bounce the ball
indefinitly and if the ball falls off nothing happens.
